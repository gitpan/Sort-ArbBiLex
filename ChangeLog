	* Version 3.31 -- adding import method; relevent doc changes.
	* Fixing apparently obscure bug in the code to check that glyphs
	in long-form (rLoL) declarations aren't references.
	* Moved all the POD to after the end of the module code.
	* Deturgidified the discussion of runtime/compiletime function
	declaration.

	* Versions before 3.1 -- dozens of test versions I kicked around
	for months and months.  Scads of interface changes, a good
	half-dozen changes in the module name.  Endless changes to the
	docs.

	* Release 3.1 -- first release version.
